"""The reviewer and the gate agree on a name, or re-evaluation fails silently.

TOOL-021 Part 2 (#1140). `review-attestation.yml` re-reads its verdict on
`workflow_run: workflows: [pr-agent]`, because comments authored with
`GITHUB_TOKEN` emit no events and the gate would otherwise compute a verdict
seconds after the PR opens and never revise it.

That makes the reviewer workflow's `name:` a two-file agreement. Rename either
side and nothing errors: the reviewer still reviews, the gate simply never looks
again, and every PR it reviewed reads as unreviewed. A guarantee that degrades
into silence when a string drifts is the failure class this repo has spent days
cataloguing, so it is asserted rather than left as a convention.
